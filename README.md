> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please **take a backup first**. VAT/tax calculation is only suitable for my usecase (enter prices without and only add it at checkout, relying on built-in tax calculation methods). Depending on what regions and tax laws you have to comply with this may or may not apply to you.

Bulk update existing WooCommerce Subscriptions when the prices of products change via WP-CLI (verbose by default).

There's two premium plugins to do this but given it's literally like 20 lines of code to do this, I thought that was a little silly. Free to use. :)

I chose to do this via WP-CLI because depending on how many subscriptions you might have it didn't seem right to waste resources running this through the WP-Admin UI, and using WP-CLI makes it a breeze to keep a log of each item that's been updated in case something seems to be wrong.

## How to
2. Install either as an [MU-Plugin](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/plugins/mu-plugins/) (single file) or via regular plugin installation means.
3. SSH to your server (some providers give you a console for this, otherwise do so manually) and navigate to your WP installation directory.
4. Perform a dry run first to confirm this will do what you want:
    ```bash
    wp wcsr recalculate --dry-run
    ```
5. If everything looks right, run it again for real:
    ```bash
    wp wcsr recalculate
    ```
6. You'll see a message in the terminal congratulating you if ran successfully. ðŸŽ‰
